Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Ad Vitam and uh... yeah, I have thoughts. Man, what a ride. It’s like they took my brain, put it in a blender with some futuristic paint, and let it spin at will this ever end? pace. Not that it was bad—don't get me wrong. It's just wild. Whoever decided eternity could be a mix of disillusionment and neon lights had a point. But hey, eternity's gotta have its mood swings, right?

So, picture this: you live forever but, uh, it's like living in a slow-motion existential crisis. People don't really die, they just kind of... shuffle off-stage until they decide they've had enough of eternal breakfast cereal mornings. Makes me think if I really want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , but then again, maybe it'll hit better when I'm not floating through my own daydreams about lifting weights.

> There's something oddly hilarious about 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 characters who look like they've been draped in some leftover Halloween costumes while they ponder life's grand mysteries. They looked as tired as I do after leg day, struggling to recognize themselves in a mirror's glare. It's both too real and completely alien. One moment you're like, who hurt you? and next you're saying seriously, who dressed you?!.

The visuals, though, they were something else. Like if you've ever tried staring at a lava lamp while half-asleep—it gets into your head in unexpected ways. Too much or too little, no in-between. The grungy cityscapes felt like they'd be an excellent place to set up a squat rack. Which is saying something considering how my gym's a different universe—full of walls shaking to the sound of AC/DC rather than whatever ethereal whispers they had in this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮.

Here's the thing. It’s like they wrapped this neat little narrative in existential aluminum foil, and you have to unwrap it—but you kinda forget what you were unwrapping halfway through. Did I leave the fridge open? Back to the point—I'm not entirely sure if I loved it or if I need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to settle the cyclone in my mind.

(function() { console.log(Immortality is overrated.); })();

Maybe that's what it's all about? The questions more than the answers. The moments you grab onto before they slip away like an overloaded leg press.

So yeah. Worth seeing? I'd say so. Not every day you get to see immortality wrapped up in such a chaotic dance of tiny shortsighted people. Give it a go. Or not. Just don't ask me for spoilers, because chances are I'm still trying to process the whole eternal kaleidoscope of things.
